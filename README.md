# Selfnet-Wifi-Config

This is an Android Application that helps to create a profile for the [Selfnet wireless LAN](https://www.selfnet.de/services/wlan.html) with the correct settings provided you put in the correct login credentials.

[Selfnet e.V.](https://www.selfnet.de/) is a non-profit student association run entirely by volunteers. We supply students with a broadband network in the dormitories of Stuttgart and our primary goal is the transfer of knowledge. Members of the association are allowed to use the membership services (like the access to the [dormitory network](https://www.selfnet.de/services/network.html)).

The Selfnet wireless network SSID is only available in dormitories where the necessary Access Points have been deployed. See [our website](https://www.selfnet.de/services/wlan.html) regarding the availability.

A HowTo that describes how to manually configure your device can also be found on our website: https://www.selfnet.de/wlan-guide
